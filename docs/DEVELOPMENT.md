# Prerequisites

You will need to install [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka
"babaska, A Clojure babushka for the grey areas of Bash").

It is much easier to work with the project using
[borkdude/deps.clj](https://github.com/borkdude/deps.clj)


Add the projects's bin directory to your path, or always invoke it directly.
